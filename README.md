We aim to create a community-driven resource that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and joy for all children, regardless of their sensory needs.

## Introduction
Zebrate is designed to help parents and caregivers of autistic children find entertainment venues that are sensory-friendly and equipped to handle their specific needs. Our platform was developed in response to a survey indicating that 85.18% of our target user group see a need for such a product. Common challenges identified include untrained staff, unpredictable environments, lack of suitable facilities, and overcrowding.

<br> Please update our progressboard according to the work you do https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKCTQ4XA=/


once we start putting places, we need to maintain the same database on every computer where the app is tested <br>
should we even stick to sqlite?

## backend work
<br>
<br>

1. language-wise organisation (keep track of requirements.txt and all this version stuff)
2. infrastructure (docker containers will do the trick, do not forget to remove pandas from the requirements)
3. Miro board easy task organization (see above)

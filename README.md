# Zebrate: Autism-Friendly Social Entertainment

Deployed: https://zebrate-73xg.onrender.com/ (Since we are using the free plan, if the website is not accessed by anyone for 15 minutes, it is taken down by render, so accessing the website after that would require about 1-2 minutes of loading time!)

Welcome to Zebrate! This project aims to assist parents and caregivers of autistic children in finding suitable entertainment venues that cater to their specific needs. Our platform offers detailed venue reviews and filters to ensure an enjoyable experience for all.


## Who We Are
Group members: Ali Badran, Franziscka Wojtkowski, Paya Karimi, Paniz Ziaie.
We are a group of 4th semester health informatics students passionate about leveraging technology to improve the quality of life for individuals with autism and their families. Our team combines expertise in healthcare, technology, business mgmt and user experience design to create a platform that addresses the unique challenges faced by parents and caregivers of autistic children.


## Mission Statement
Our mission is to empower parents and caregivers of autistic children by providing a reliable and user-friendly platform to find suitable entertainment venues. We aim to create a community-driven resource that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and joy for all children, regardless of their sensory needs.

## Introduction
Zebrate is designed to help parents and caregivers of autistic children find entertainment venues that are sensory-friendly and equipped to handle their specific needs. Our platform was developed in response to a survey indicating that 85.18% of our target user group see a need for such a product. Common challenges identified include untrained staff, unpredictable environments, lack of suitable facilities, and overcrowding.

## Features

- **Alerts:** Notifications for unusually busy hours or days.
- **Proximity Search:** Find venues within a specific distance radius.
- **User Reviews:** Detailed reviews from other parents and caregivers.
- **Venue Requests:** Users can request to add new venues through a form on the website.

## Development Tools
- **Figma:** UX prototyping and UI design
- **Python + FastAPI:** Backend development
- **HTML5 + CSS + JavaScript:** Frontend development
- **SQLite:** Database
- **GitHub:** Code management and version control

<br> Please update our progressboard according to the work you do https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKCTQ4XA=/


once we start putting places, we need to maintain the same database on every computer where the app is tested <br>
should we even stick to sqlite?

## backend work

1. language-wise organisation (keep track of requirements.txt and all this version stuff)
2. infrastructure (docker containers will do the trick, do not forget to remove pandas from the requirements)
3. Miro board easy task organization (see above)
